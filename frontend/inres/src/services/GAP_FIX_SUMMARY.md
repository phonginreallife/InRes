# Schedule Transformer Gap Fix

## Problem Description

The `demo-schedule-transformer.js` had an issue where there were gaps between shifts when the handoff time was different from the start time. 

### Original Issue Example:
- **Shift 1 - Alice**: `2025-01-01T09:00:00.000Z` → `2025-01-08T02:00:00.000Z`
- **Shift 2 - Bob**: `2025-01-08T09:00:00.000Z` → `2025-01-15T02:00:00.000Z`

**Problem**: Alice's shift ends at 02:00 but Bob's shift doesn't start until 09:00, creating a **7-hour gap** with no coverage.

## Root Cause

In the original `generateRotationShifts` function, the logic calculated shift start times based on:
```javascript
// OLD LOGIC - caused gaps
const shiftStartTime = new Date(rotationStartDateTime);
shiftStartTime.setDate(rotationStartDateTime.getDate() + (shiftIndex * shiftDurationDays));
```

This meant each shift always started at the same time of day (e.g., 09:00), regardless of when the previous shift ended.

## Solution

Modified the `generateRotationShifts` function to ensure **continuous coverage**:

### Key Changes:

1. **Track Previous Shift End Time**: Added `previousShiftEndTime` variable to track when the last shift ended.

2. **Continuous Start Times**: Make each shift start exactly when the previous shift ended:
```javascript
// NEW LOGIC - ensures continuous coverage
let shiftStartTime;
if (shiftIndex === 0) {
  // First shift starts at rotation start time
  shiftStartTime = new Date(rotationStartDateTime);
} else {
  // Subsequent shifts start when previous shift ended
  shiftStartTime = new Date(previousShiftEndTime);
}
```

3. **Fixed Timezone Issue**: Changed `setHours()` to `setUTCHours()` to ensure consistent UTC time handling.

### Result After Fix:
- **Shift 1 - Alice**: `2025-01-01T09:00:00.000Z` → `2025-01-08T02:00:00.000Z`
- **Shift 2 - Bob**: `2025-01-08T02:00:00.000Z` → `2025-01-15T02:00:00.000Z` [OK]
- **Shift 3 - Charlie**: `2025-01-15T02:00:00.000Z` → `2025-01-22T02:00:00.000Z` [OK]

**Result**: **0 hours gap** between all shifts - perfect continuous coverage!

## Files Modified

1. **`scheduleTransformer.js`**:
   - Updated `generateRotationShifts()` function
   - Updated `calculateMemberTimes()` function
   - Changed `setHours()` to `setUTCHours()` for timezone consistency

2. **`scheduleTransformer.test.js`**:
   - Added new test case `should ensure continuous coverage with no gaps between shifts`
   - Verifies that each shift starts exactly when the previous one ends

3. **`demo-schedule-transformer.js`**:
   - Updated handoff time to `02:00` to match the example scenario

## Testing

Created verification scripts to demonstrate the fix:
- `test-gap-fix.js` - Shows the fix working with detailed logging
- `verify-gap-fix.js` - Compares old vs new logic side-by-side

### Test Results:
```
OLD Logic: [WARNING] GAP: 7 hours between shifts
NEW Logic: [OK] Perfect handoff: continuous coverage
```

## Impact

- **Before**: Gaps in coverage when handoff time ≠ start time
- **After**: Guaranteed continuous 24/7 coverage
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality preserved
- **Timezone Safe**: Uses UTC time handling consistently

The fix ensures that on-call rotations provide true continuous coverage with no gaps, which is critical for production systems requiring 24/7 monitoring.
