## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT create a public issue. Instead:

1. Use the **"Report a vulnerability"** button under the **Security** tab of this repository.
2. Provide a detailed description, PoC, and impact.

This allows us to discuss and fix the issue privately. You will receive updates directly through GitHub notifications.
